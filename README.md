# One HTML
I love torturing myself, so here is FNF ported to 1 (one) single HTML file. It's not minified, but it's still a single file.

## Why?
As I said above, I love torturing myself. I also wanted to see if I could do it...

## How?
One word. Coding...

## How long did it take?
TBD. Project is still in progress.

## How big is it?
